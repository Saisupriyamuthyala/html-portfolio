<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>This is saisupriya muthyala. I am a student intrested in learning coding and web development skills.
I have recently completed my undergraduation  that is BSC.mscs and I'M going to start a new career by joining in mca.
I know coding is not a cakewalk unless we practise a lot on it,But im trying to give my best .</p>
<p>AT the beginning I have zero knowledge on coding and i have scared a lot about it. Then i started searching for learning sources andfinally i got a best option.Now i have made a first step and created my own website.
This tells that everything is possible if we stay confident and try constantly.This is a tiny thing and I think this is a boost and its just a beginning .</p>
<p>This project is very much special to me cause its my first own project that made by myself .I am very grateful to DR.angela yu mam ,her motivation is priceless.She turns every class very beautifully and inspires me everytime.Hope I would create many more projects like this</p>
